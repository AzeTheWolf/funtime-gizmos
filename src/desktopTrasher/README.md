# Funtime Gizmos - Desktop Trasher
## **⚠️Potentially harmful⚠️**

**Windows only!**

---
Windows has a set of restricted filenames that were once reserved for device files. Turns out Windows still won't let you use those names... except it sometimes does. But once those files are there, they are quite pain in the back to remove. Also, uneditable 😈. 

This Gizmo creates every single device file there is, right on your desktop.

## Usage
To throw trash around your desktop, simply run the script.

For easy cleanup, add "clean" parameter
> node desktopTrasher.js clean

or when packaged:
> desktopTrasher.exe clean
