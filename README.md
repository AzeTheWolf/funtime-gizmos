# Funtime Gizmos
A set of small things I did in my free time. Some are useful, some are not, and some are even plain rude. Enjoy.

**NOTE:** This is not a serious project! It may even not work in some cases.

## Usage
Gizmos are written in JavaScript and meant to be run in [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org). If you want to, feel free to package them into an executable (personally, I use [nexe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nexe)).

### List of Gizmos
Below is a list of Gizmos with a short description. Each gizmo also has its dedicated readme inside its directory.
